    <p>When i was in 8th grade my parents surprised me by 
        taking me to fermi national labs. I was so excited 
        to go. When i got there i was answering almost every 
        question and some guy took notice. My mom exchanged
         are info without thinking much of it. About a year
          goes by and im at a summer camp on my birthday and 
          a package arrives filled with books with notes on
        them guiding me from every level. I wrote him a huge 
        thank you letter from my heart but i no longer had his 
        companys address from the box. This is my thank you to 
        you random man for rekindling my childish joy and spark
        for physics</p>
